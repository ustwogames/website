#### Weâ€™re looking for a talented Junior Programmer to join ustwo games and help us to build on the success of our released titles, making new games with stand-out production values, heart and broad appeal.

This role requires someone smart, passionate and creative, looking to gain professional experience in a supportive environment whilst immediately contributing to the development of new titles. Working and learning with the guidance of a senior programmer, you'll join the technical team on a project, collaborating closely with other disciplines and helping maintain a high level of code quality and technical innovation.
