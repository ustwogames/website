#### We’re looking for a talented Junior Programmer to join ustwo games and help us to build on the success of our released titles, making new games with stand-out production values, heart and broad appeal.

This role requires someone smart, passionate and creative, looking to gain professional experience in a supportive environment whilst immediately contributing to the development of new titles. Working and learning with the guidance of a senior programmer, you'll join the technical team on a project, collaborating closely with other disciplines and helping maintain a high level of code quality and technical innovation.

If you want to work on something outside the norm which has an impact on the world, in a welcoming environment, then come and help us make games that will be loved worldwide.
