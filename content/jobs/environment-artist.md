#### We're looking for a talented environment artist to join our team and help us create new experiences for mobile players and beyond.

This artist could be you!

You are an environment artist with strong 3D capabilities and the ability to work in a wide range of styles, with  experience working as an environment artist within the games industry.

You have a solid grounding in traditional arts as well as a technical mindset and a keen eye for detail. You are an observer of the real world. You are capable of producing believable yet stylised environmental concept art, and of creating 3D models and layouts to turn that concept art into the places our players are going to spend their time in. You have a strong understanding of lighting, atmospheric effects and environmental storytelling, both from a technical and artistic point of view.
