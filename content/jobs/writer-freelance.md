#### We’re looking for a freelance writer who will use their confident and wide-ranging understanding of narrative to work with us in developing an original story for our next project.

This role is ideal for someone who has proven experience collaborating successfully within creative teams (in video games or other creative formats), and of spearheading the development of a story from early stages through to final execution.

It requires someone confident in shaping characters and expressing their identities through pacy, authentic dialogue. You have a passion for drama in all its forms, and are excited by the challenge of bringing a more domestic, character-focused story to a mobile gaming audience.

We’re excited about the potential of bringing new genres and styles of storytelling to games, and so would love to hear from writers who may previously have only written in non-interactive formats, as well as experienced games writers.

Deadline for applications is: Friday, 5th October, 2018.
