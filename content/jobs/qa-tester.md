#### We’re looking for a passionate and hardworking individual to join our team in London and help us make the best games possible.

You’ll be working as our internal functionality tester; finding issues in our games and reporting them in our bug database.

You will work closely with our designers, artists, programmers and producers day to day as we turn new and exciting ideas into finished games that we hope the world will love.

If you are keen to learn how the different aspects of game development work together to create a finished product and love to work as part of an inclusive team, where you feel valued and appreciated for the work you do, this may be the role for you!
